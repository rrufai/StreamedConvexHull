TODO:

Layers problem

1. Consider a dynamic algorithm for the layers problem
2. Proof that the intersection of the two convex polygons (4 half-hulls) yield a convex layer


Streaming Algorithm

1. Error analysis -- complete proof that the error bound is O(1/k^2).
2. Algorithm results for points distributed in a disk.


todo:

1. Proof that the intersection of the two polygons are old points
2. Only points eliminated by the intersection are the pseudo points introduced.
3. Simplify the merge and intersertion steps.

proof: the union of the four half-layer i's remaining after computing the (i-1) layers constitute the i-th layer.

by contradiction.
